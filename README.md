# Evaluating Author Attribution on Darija Tweets
### ___Abstract___
This work aims to apply and assess the existing Authorship Attribution techniques, on Moroccan Arabic (Darija) social media electronic texts (tweets). Authorship Attribution is a stylometry problem that aims to deduce the identity of the authors by examining e-texts only. 
We introduce the Moroccan Darija Author Attribution Tweets datasets with 30 authors in total so far [`dataset_directory = './data/'`](https://github.com/nainiayoub/evaluating-aa-on-darija-tweets/tree/main/data), as well as our approach to build a Random Forests Author Attribution model.
